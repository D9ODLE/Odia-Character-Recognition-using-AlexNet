# Odia-Character-Recognition-using-AlexNet
is project focuses on the development of a deep learning model to recognize handwritten Odia characters, comprising 41 consonants and 11 vowels. Leveraging the AlexNet architecture, the model processes pre-segmented character images to perform multi-class classification. The dataset is organized into folders representing individual characters, with images normalized and resized to match the input requirements of AlexNet.
